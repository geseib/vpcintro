# Getting Started

To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

- ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](/15-prerequisites/self_paced.html), or
- ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](/15-prerequsites/aws_event.html)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Default VPC**](/20-intro.html)
