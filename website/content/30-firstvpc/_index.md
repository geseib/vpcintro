## Creating your First VPC from Scratch

There are several ways to quickly create a VPC. You can Launch the VPC Wizard in the [Amazon VPC Console](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) or use Infrastrucutre as code using [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) **We will do this later in the workshop**

However in this workshop, we will build a VPC Piece by Piece, so we can see all of the components.
