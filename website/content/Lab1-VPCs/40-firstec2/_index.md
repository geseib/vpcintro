## Creating your First EC2 Instance

There are several ways to quickly create a EC2. You could use Infrastrucutre as code using [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) **We will do this later in the workshop**

However in this workshop, we will build a EC2 manually, so we can see all of the components.
